An example of a manifest generated from the repository `github.com/epinio/helm-chart` is:

```
####################
# EPINIO-EPINIO-UI #
####################

spec:
    name: epinio-epinio-ui
    sources:
        epinio-ui:
            name: Get latest "epinio-ui" Helm Chart Version
            kind: helmchart
            spec:
                name: epinio-ui
                url: https://epinio.github.io/helm-charts
    conditions:
        epinio-ui:
            name: Ensure dependency "epinio-ui" is specified
            kind: yaml
            spec:
                file: chart/epinio/Chart.yaml
                key: dependencies[2].name
                value: epinio-ui
            disablesourceinput: true
    targets:
        epinio-ui:
            name: Bump chart dependency "epinio-ui" in Chart "epinio"
            kind: helmchart
            spec:
                file: Chart.yaml
                key: dependencies[2].version
                name: chart/epinio
                versionincrement: minor
            sourceid: epinio-ui
```

A crawler should be able to:

* Ignore manifest based on rules such as
** Pipeline name
** Dependency name
* Only update based on rules such as
** Pipeline name
** Dependency name

This is especially important as we may have a "classic" manifest that handle a dependency in a specific way.
