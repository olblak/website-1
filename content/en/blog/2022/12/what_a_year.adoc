== 2022 is over and what a year!

2022 has been awesome for the Updatecli project.
Updatecli went from a tool mainly used within the Jenkins project to a project that others organizations could rely on to keep their git repositories up to date.

Firstly, with link:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30286047[HackerNews], then with link:https://youtu.be/157bsLD-0mM[CDcon], the project received many feedback and evolved a lot. 2022 was rich in opportunities to understand how project maintainers benefit from Updatecli.

With the user base growing came many feature requests and new update scenarios.

Updatecli over this year:

- 45 releases
- 15 new contributors
- Many plugins addition, or improvement
- A project Logo!
- First (not expected) blog posts

Several major ideas came to life

**Manifest validation**

For decades, software projects maintained scripts written in many different languages to automate their project updates. All Updatecli's contributors maintained scripts like those. They also saw them being copy-paste across repositories up to a point where most of the logic was just technical debts that nobody knew about.

With Updatecli, the goal was to have a declarative way of describing those Updates, to reduce the complexity of maintaining those scripts.
Unfortunately, with each new DSL comes to some learning curve.
Using the Updatecli new DSL was error-prone, and maintaining the documentation, was time-consuming.

The project started generating and publishing "Jsonschema" on the "Jonschemastore" so everybody could benefit from validation and documentation, right from their IDE without any additional configurations.
All they had to do was to have their Updatecli manifest files live within `updatecli.d` directory. The Jsonschema also benefits the documentation website which means fewer things to maintain...

**GitHub action**

Updatecli works great from a local machine, but it works even better when executed from CI environment.

CI tooling offers many different kinds of trigger mechanisms that benefit Updatecli.
Here some example

* GitOps - triggered by a scheduler, Updatecli keeps GitOps repository up to date
* Release - triggered by a release event, Updatecli can propagate a new release version quickly to downstream git repositories.

Thanks, Joseph Petersen, who made the Updatecli GitHub Action, what it's today.

**Autodiscovery**

Updatecli started as a way to describe advanced Update scenarios using manifests. Of course for standard Update scenarios, manifests can be redundant, and sometimes a project needs a mix of both.
That's what Updatecli "Autodiscovery" is about.
The purpose is to let Updatecli analyze files from a directory and then generate standard Update manifests before applying them. Autodiscovery is complementary to the manifest approach and is still an experiment.

Over the year, Updatecli started supporting automatic update for Dockerfile, Docker Compose file, Helm, Helmfile, Rancher Fleet, and Maven.

Users can run one of the following commands from whatever directory to see what would change.

* `updatecli diff --experimental`
* `updatecli manifest show --experimental`
* `updatecli apply --experimental`


**Updatemonitor**

The Updatemonitor app was another well received-experiment.
While still in an early stage, the Updatemonitor app is a long-running service that leverages Updatecli plugins to monitor all kinds of information.
